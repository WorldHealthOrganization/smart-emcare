Measures included in this implementation guide are listed in the Artifact Index - Measures

For the operational descriptions of indicators and references, see the Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK): SMART Guidelines for Immunizations, including Web Annex C of the DAK. Summary indicator content from the DAK is also represented in the Indicators and Performance Metrics page.
